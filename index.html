    <p id="about-text">
      My name is Ben Elbaz. I have some experience in JavaScript, HTML and CSS
      from this class, and Python from outside of class. I would like to learn
      more Python and JS. I am also learning some arduino for robotics. I have
      really enjoyed coding in this class and throughout my life, and hope to
      use it as a tool in my future.
